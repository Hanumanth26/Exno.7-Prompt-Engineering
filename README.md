# Aim: To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.



# Algorithm:
Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## üîπ Stage 1: Basic Prompt Design
Goal: Simple task listing.

##  Prompt
‚ÄúHelp me create a to-do list for today.‚Äù

## Output

5. Lunch break (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)
6. Work on bug fixes and backlog tasks (1:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
7. Optional: Tech article reading or learning (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
## üî∏ Application Use
Capture user role and preferences.

Dynamically adjust schedule generation.

## üîπ Stage 4: Interactive Prompting
Goal: Dynamic conversation for iterative refinement.

## üî∏ Conversation Flow
User: ‚ÄúPlan my workday. I have a project deadline this Friday.‚Äù
ChatGPT: ‚ÄúHow many hours can you work today and when are you most productive?‚Äù
User: ‚Äú6 hours total. I'm best between 9 AM and noon.‚Äù

Workday Plan (Deadline Focused):
1. 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Deep work on project deliverables
2. 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Break
3. 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Continue project work
4. 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM: Review and testing
5. 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM: Plan next steps and wrap-up
## üî∏ Application Use
Chat-like UI for back-and-forth.

Store conversation state and iterate.

## üîπ Stage 5: Advanced Prompting with Task Management Features
Goal: Integrate task tracking, priorities, and categories.

## üî∏ Prompt
‚ÄúCreate a task list for a working parent who needs to juggle coding tasks, child drop-off/pick-up, and self-care. Highlight top 3 priorities.‚Äù

## üî∏ Output

Daily Plan (Working Parent - Prioritized)

**Top 3 Priorities:**
‚úÖ Submit project proposal (High Priority)
‚úÖ Pick up kids from school by 3:30 PM
‚úÖ 30-minute self-care (meditation or walk)

**Full To-Do List:**
1. 7:30 AM - Drop off kids
2. 8:00 AM - Deep coding session
3. 10:00 AM - Check-in with team
4. 11:00 AM - Work on project proposal (High)
5. 12:30 PM - Lunch break + short walk
6. 1:30 PM - Client feedback review
7. 3:00 PM - Wrap up tasks
8. 3:30 PM - Pick up kids (High)
9. 5:00 PM - 30-min self-care (High)
10. Evening - Light email triage or relax
## üî∏ Application Use
Multi-input form: roles, responsibilities, priorities.

Output formatted into a task board or exportable list.


Identify the user's primary needs:

Creativity Boost: Idea generation, brainstorming, storytelling, art prompts.

Practical Problem-Solving: Coding help, decision-making, productivity hacks.

Personalization: Learning style, domain-specific tasks (e.g., business, academics).

Example Prompt:
"You are a creative assistant that helps users solve problems in [specific domain]. Ask clarifying questions to tailor responses to their unique needs, then provide step-by-step guidance or creative ideas."

## 2. Key Features to Include
## A. Adaptive Prompting
User Profiling: Start with questions to understand goals (e.g., "Are you solving a technical problem or seeking creative inspiration?").

Context Awareness: Allow follow-up prompts to refine outputs (e.g., "Make this more detailed" or "Simplify for a beginner").

## B. Creativity Modules
Idea Generation: "Suggest 5 unconventional solutions for [problem]."

Story/Writing Aid: "Help me outline a story about [theme] with a twist."

Visual Art Prompts: "Describe a surreal painting combining [element A] and [element B]."

## C. Problem-Solving Tools
Step-by-Step Guides: "Break down how to fix [issue] into 5 steps."

Pros/Cons Lists: "Compare options for [decision] with risks and benefits."

Code Debugging: "Explain why this [code snippet] fails and rewrite it."

## D. Feedback Loop
Let users rate outputs (e.g., "Was this helpful? How can I improve?") to refine future responses.


## 3. Technical Implementation
Backend: Use LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) with prompt chaining.

Frontend: Simple UI (Chat-like or form-based) for input/output.

Customization: Save user preferences (e.g., "Always give concise answers").

Tools:

Python + LangChain for dynamic prompting.

Streamlit/Gradio for quick prototyping, or React for scalable apps.


## 4. Example Use Cases
Entrepreneur: "Generate a lean canvas for a [product] startup."

Student: "Explain quantum physics using analogies."

Writer: "Suggest plot twists for a mystery set in [location]."

## **5. Sample Prompt Template
markdown
**Role**: You are a [role, e.g., brainstorming coach].  
**Task**: Help the user [goal, e.g., solve X creatively].  
**Rules**:  
- Ask 1‚Äì2 clarifying questions first.  
- Offer 3 options, then refine based on feedback.  
- Use analogies/examples for clarity.  

**User Input**: [Insert query here]**


## 6. Ethical Considerations
Bias Mitigation: "Provide balanced perspectives on [controversial topic]."

Privacy: Avoid storing personal data without consent.









## Outcome:
Users get a tailored tool that evolves with their needs, enhancing creativity and critical thinking through structured LLM interactions.
Export as JSON for use in a mobile/desktop app

Format as calendar events

Voice summary

Adaptive suggestions (e.g. "Would you like to skip brainstorming if still tired at 1 PM?")






# Result:
The Prompt is executed successfully
